#### Netflix data Analysis - Python

A detailed analysis of  data history on Netflix from 2008 - 2021 using pandas and seaborn in python.
N.B : Refer the jupyter notebooks to understand better. This README file is just a description of the project.
File Wrangling_Netflix_titles.ipynb contains initial data cleaning and wrangling using which I export the data to a csv file.
File Netflix_Data_Analysis.ipynb contains all the working for generating the visualizations.

### Motivation

Netflix is a popular streaming service with a vastÂ selection of movies, TV episodes, and original material. The original dataset, which can be accessed here, has been cleaned up and made available in this dataset. The data consists of the content that Netflix added between 2008 and 2021. The aim of this project is to analyse the Netflix data and find some interesting trends and how it has changed over time.
